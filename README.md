# Bitwise_Programs_in_C


For advance bit twiddling refer the stanford bit hacks.

bitwise operations mainly deals with Data compression , encryption and Low level hardware Interaction.


for optimizing the operations on bits , a benchmarking example is presented by using C programming utility , as shown in the  count_set_bits_benchmarking.c example.
